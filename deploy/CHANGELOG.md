## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-19

### Added

- Preview follows Burrow's rows (`rowPreview`): with Roam's preview open (Ctrl-O), a selected alias row shows its page there and a selected referenced block shows its place in the outline, instead of Roam's "Select a page to preview"; while the ⌥A field or the delete confirm is open, it shows that page.
- Create an alias from the picker (`aliasCreate`, **off by default**, writes to the graph): ⌥A on a highlighted page row in `[[` opens an alias field seeded with the query; Enter appends the alias to that page's alias block (or creates `Aliases:: alias` as its first block) and inserts `[alias]([[Page]])`; Esc cancels. Only that one block changes. IME and dead-key input (⌥E then E) compose into the field; the block keeps exactly its `[[query`.
- Delete an alias from the chips (`aliasDelete`, **off by default**, writes to the graph): Alt+Backspace on the selected chip asks to confirm; Enter removes only that alias from the alias block, Esc keeps it.
- Ordinal matching in drill (`drillOrdinals`): `1`, `2`, `(b)`, `iii` rank blocks that start with that ordinal first, in the Tab-drill filter and in typed `> step` drills.
- Empty blocks in drill (`drillEmpty`): empty leaf blocks are left out of the list and the preview; empty blocks with children show as `(empty) ▸` and stay drillable; the first selected row skips them.
- Long levels in slices (`drillCap`): a drill level lists 50 blocks and a `+N more` row that lists the next 50; the drill preview caps each level with `+N more` too.
- Block reference search (`refSearch`): palette command **Burrow: block reference search** opens `((` at the caret of the block being edited (also after the palette took focus). Optional Alt+Shift+9 for it (`refSearchHotkey`, off by default; Roam has no default use for that key).
- Ctrl-O in the Tab-drill panel shows or hides its preview.
- Live gates: cases for every item above, mouse use in the drill panel (click a child, a crumb, click away), the popup opening above the text, a `--theme light|dark` flag, a cost run with Roam's preview open (`perf-gate --preview`, part of `gate:live`), and `tools/shots.mjs` for before/after screenshots. A crashed gate run leaves no fixture behind: the next run removes what the ledger lists, and Ctrl-C cleans up.

### Changed

- Aliases are read from an alias block's first line only, and ⌥A / Alt+Backspace change only that line: a note on a second line is no longer appended to, read as part of the last alias, or deleted with it. An alias may not start with `#` (Roam would read it as a tag).
- Alias chips scroll with the mouse wheel or trackpad, so every chip can be clicked; each chip carries its full alias as a tooltip, and the selected chip grows to the whole line so a long alias shows in full.
- Key hints read like RefX: `⌥A alias · ⌥↓ pick alias · ⇥/> drill · ⌃O preview · ↵ insert` in the picker, `⇥/> drill · ⇧⇥ back · ⌃O preview · ↵ insert · esc results` in the drill panel.
- The gates' click-away case clicks Roam's top bar, so it no longer moves the main window.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-10-18

### Added

- Alias rows with their page (`aliasInline`): one row per page, `alias ↳ Page` with its reference count, also when roam-aliases is installed. roam-aliases' rows for pages Burrow shows are hidden, so no alias is listed twice; the rest stay in its column.
- Alias pre-select (`aliasPreselect`): when an alias starts with the typed text and no page has exactly that title, its row starts selected.
- Alias chips (`aliasChips`): the selected alias row's aliases as chips; ⌥↓ moves into them, ←/→ picks, Enter inserts with that alias. Chips keep their width and the line scrolls to the selected one, so long aliases never run together.
- Tab drill (`tabDrill`): Tab on the highlighted page (Roam's row or Burrow's), a referenced block in `((`, or a resolved drill-down lists its children in place under a breadcrumb, with a filter that never reaches the block, a preview of the highlighted child, Tab / `>` deeper, Shift+Tab back, Enter inserting the child's `((uid))`. Nothing to drill into: Tab is Roam's.
- Keep panes apart (`paneLayout`): roam-aliases' column becomes a band above Roam's list (preview closed) or above the list column (preview open) instead of lying over Roam's list or preview.
- Key hints (`keyHints`): a line under Roam's list naming Burrow's keys; the drill panel has its own.
- Idle query for alias pages' reference counts.

### Changed

- Burrow's rows, chips and hint line pad Roam's list column only, so Roam's preview keeps its full height. The padding is a static class per size (`burrow-pad-N`, `-Nc` with the chips): rewriting a stylesheet whenever the row count changed restyled the whole document and cost 3+ ms on those keys in a dark theme.
- Burrow tracks every open `[[` / `((` token (layout, fold, hints and Tab need the popup even without rows of its own); still no data read per keystroke.
- Dev tools: `tools/dev-load.mjs` and the live and perf gates park an installed Burrow in memory while they run and put it back afterwards, so they work in a window that has the Depot build installed. `dev-load.mjs status` no longer unloads the dev build.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-10-17

### Added

- Drill-down in `[[`: `title#heading > child` resolves to a block, Enter or Tab inserts its `((uid))`, and an unresolved expression inserts `[[Page]]`, never a new page. Starts only after an exact title or alias; titles with `#` or `>` that have content stay native.
- Drill-down preview: a read-only outline over Roam's preview area (or beside the popup) with the parent trail, siblings, two levels of children, the resolved block highlighted and scrolled into view.
- Lazy page reads for drill-down: one pull per block visited, one heading lookup per page, cached until the popup closes.
- Pick memory for `((` and alias rows, off by default, kept in this browser.
- Current-page boost among equal referenced blocks in `((`.
- Switches `drill`, `drillPreview`, `pickMemory`, `pageBoost`; the disable-all command covers them.
- Live gates: drill cases on four arms (on, off, gone, drill off) with a page-count check, a real drill per graph, a pick-memory case, and a drill cost run with the preview open.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-17

### Added

- Alias rows in `[[` from `Aliases::` blocks (case-insensitive), inserting `[alias]([[Page]])` or `[[Page]]`; hidden where roam-aliases or Roam already shows the page.
- Referenced-first strip in `((`: originals before quoters, inbound-ref ranking, pre-selected top original.
- Alias query expansion in `((`.
- Search scorer ported from thymer-reference-extravaganza, with word-boundary substring matching.
- Explicit keyboard ownership state machine and byte-for-byte guarded commit.
- One settings switch per feature, a disable-all command, and a per-key cost readout.
